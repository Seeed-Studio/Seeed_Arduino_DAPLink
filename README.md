# Seeed_Arduino_DAPLink

Most of Seeed & Adafruit boards Seeeduino M0/M4, featuring M0, M4 and nRF52840 are able to run the daplink sketch. It allows us to flash/burn bootloader of any ARM Cortex-M MCU (M0, M4, nRF52832, nRF52840 etc ..) and step debugging with gdb and/or supported IDE such as eclipse,  Keil, IAR. For your convenience, a precompiled daplink firmware in uf2 format for specific board can be found at wiki page
